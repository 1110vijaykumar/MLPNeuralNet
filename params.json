{"name":"MLPNeuralNet","tagline":"Fast multilayer perceptron neural network library for iOS and Mac OS X","body":"<!--- Need to wait untill travis-ci update their xcode to 5.0\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nikolaypavlov/MLPNeuralNet.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nikolaypavlov/MLPNeuralNet.png?branch=master)\r\n-->\r\n# MLPNeuralNet\r\nFast [multilayer perceptron](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) neural network library for iOS and Mac OS X. MLPNeuralNet predicts new examples by trained neural network. It is built on top of the [Apple's Accelerate Framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Accelerate/Reference/AccelerateFWRef/_index.html), using vectorized operations and hardware acceleration if available.\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\" >\r\n  <img src=\"http://nikolaypavlov.github.io/MLPNeuralNet/images/500px-Artificial_neural_network.png\" alt=\"Neural Network\" title=\"Neural Network\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n## Why to choose it?\r\nImagine that you created a prediction model in Matlab (Python or R) and want to use it in iOS app. If that's the case, MLPNeuralNet is exactly what you need. It is designed to load and run models in [forward propagation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation#Phase_1:_Propagation) mode only.\r\n\r\n### Features:\r\n- [classification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_classification), [multiclass classification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiclass_classification) and regression output;\r\n- vectorized implementaion;\r\n- works with double precision;\r\n- multiple hidden layers or none (in that case it's same as logistic/linear regression)\r\n\r\n## Quick Example\r\nLet's deploy a model for the AND function ([conjunction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_conjunction)) that works as follows (of course in real world you don't have to use neural net for this :) \r\n\r\n|X1 |X2 | Y |\r\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|\r\n| 0 | 0 | 0 |\r\n| 1 | 0 | 0 |\r\n| 0 | 1 | 0 |\r\n| 1 | 1 | 1 |\r\n\r\nOur model has the following weights and network configuration:\r\n<p align=\"center\" >\r\n  <img src=\"http://nikolaypavlov.github.io/MLPNeuralNet/images/network-arch.png\" alt=\"AND model example\" title=\"AND model example\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n```objectivec\r\n\r\n// Use designated initializer to pass network configuration and weights \r\n// to the model. Note: you don't need to specify biased units (+1 above) in the \r\n// configuration.\r\nNSArray *netConfig = @[@2, @1];\r\ndouble wts[] = {-30, 20, 20};\r\nNSData *weights = [NSData dataWithBytes:wts length:sizeof(wts)];\r\n\r\nMLPNeuralNet *model = [[MLPNeuralNet alloc] initWithLayerConfig:netConfig\r\n                                                        weights:weights\r\n                                                     outputMode:MLPClassification];\r\n// Predict output of the model for new sample\r\ndouble sample[] = {0, 1};\r\nvector = [NSData dataWithBytes:sample length:sizeof(sample)];\r\nprediction = [NSMutableData dataWithLength:sizeof(double)];\r\n[model predictByFeatureVector:vector intoPredictionVector:prediction];\r\n\r\ndouble assessment = (double *)prediction.bytes;\r\nNSLog(@\"Model assessment is %f\", assessment[0]);\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Getting started \r\nThis instruction describes on how to install MLPNeuralNet using the [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/). It is written for Xcode 5, using the iOS 7 SDK. If you are familiar with with 3rd-party library management, just clone [MLPNeuralNet repo](https://github.com/nikolaypavlov/MLPNeuralNet) on Github and import it to XCode directly as a subproject.\r\n\r\n### Step 1. Install CocoaPods\r\n[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) is a dependency manager for Objective-C. Installing it is as easy as running the following commands in the terminal:\r\n```\r\n$ sudo gem install cocoapods\r\n$ pod setup\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 2. Create Podfile\r\nList MLPNeuralNet as a dependenciy in a text file named Podfile in your Xcode project directory:\r\n```\r\nplatform :ios, '7.0'\r\npod 'MLPNeuralNet', '~> 1.0.0'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 3. Install MLPNeuralNet\r\nNow you can install the dependencies in your project:\r\n```\r\n$ pod install\r\n```\r\n\r\nMake sure to always open the Xcode workspace (.xcworkspace) instead of the project file when building your project:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ open App.xcworkspace\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Step 4. Import MLPNeuralNet.h\r\n`#import \"MLPNeuralNet.h\"` to start working on your model. That's it!\r\n\r\n## Performance benchmark\r\nIn this test the neural net is grown layer by layer from `1 -> 1` configuration to `200 -> 200 -> 200 -> 1`. At each step the output is calculated and benchmarked using random input vector and random weights. Total number of weights grows from 2 to 80601 accordingly. I understand the test is quite synthetic, but I hope it illustrates the performance. I will be happy if you can propse better one :)\r\n\r\n<p align=\"center\" >\r\n  <img src=\"http://nikolaypavlov.github.io/MLPNeuralNet/images/mlp-bench-regression-ios.png\" alt=\"MLPNeuralNet performance benchmark\" title=\"MLPNeuralNet performance benchmark\">\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n## Unit Tests\r\nMLPNeuralNet includes a suite of unit tests in the MLPNeuralNetTests subdirectory.
